# rate-plan-test-cases

This repository contains sample instances of Rate Plan data conforming to the Rate Plan Schema defined here: https://github.com/Flux-Tailor/rate-plan-schema/

To validate these test cases, you should clone the Rate Plan Schema repository in a directory adjacent to the Rate Plan Test Cases repository.  Alternatively, you can link to the hosted versions on github (e.g. https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Flux-Tailor/rate-plan-schema/main/holidays.xsd).

This is a work in progress and are not yet finalized.
